# Brachistochrone Interstellar and Solar System Calculators

React components for space travel calculations.

## Scripts

`CalcInterstellarDeltav.tsx` - A simple estimate of travel times based on arbitrary Delta-v ammounts. Simple relativistic hacks in the math to get reasonable estimates.

`CalcInterstellarRelativisticRocket` - Interstellar Relativistic Rocket Calculator derived from https://github.com/nathangeffen/space-travel

`CalcPlanetBrachistochrone.py`
`CalcPlanetBrachistochrone.tsx`

Python version saves a csv and markdown file with the results of the brachistochrone trajectories at 1/3g (example below.) The .jsx is a React component version. Hosted on https://overvieweffekt.com/.

`EpsteinDriveCalculator.py`

Is a script that attempt to estimate the interstellar travel times using a relativistic brachistochrone equation for the Nauvoo from the Expanse. It is completly broken.

### Tailwind CSS Integration

These components uses Tailwind CSS classes. Make sure you have Tailwind CSS configured in your project.
