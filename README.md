# Interstellar and Brachistochrone Solar System Calculators

## Scripts

`InterstellarRocketCalculator.jsx` - Interstellar Relativistic Rocket Calculator derived from https://github.com/nathangeffen/space-travel

`BrachistochroneCalculator.py`
`BrachistochroneCalculator.jsx`

Python version saves a csv and markdown file with the results of the brachistochrone trajectories at 1/3g (example below.) The .jsx is a React component version. Hosted on https://overvieweffekt.com/.

`EpsteinDriveCalculator.py`
`EpsteinDriveCalculator.jsx`

Are scripts that attempt to estimate the interstellar travel times using a relativistic brachistochrone equation for the Nauvoo from the Expanse. that are completly broken
